# Network Security with Machine Learning 🌐

## Overwiew

In this Data Science project, you will see how to build a Network Attack Classifier from scratch using Machine Learning Techniques.

Network security is the general practice of protecting computer networks and devices accessible to the network against malicious intent, misuse and denial.

## Project structure
The datasets used in this project are:
- `BX-Book-Ratings.csv`
- `BX-Books.csv`
- `BX-Users.csv`

Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing and visualization:

- `code.ipynb`

## Steps

**1. Data Loading and Exploration:**
   - Load the datasets using pandas.
   - Display the first few rows to understand the structure of the dataset.
   - Check for missing values and data types.

**2. Visualization:**
   - Visualize the data on a 2D plot.

**3. Data Preprocessing:**
   - Extract relevant features.
   - Group by items and create a new column.

**4. k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)**
   - Apply the kNN algorithm.
   - Convert our table to a 2D matrix, and fill the missing values with zeros.

## Results

The system analyzes a reader's preferences based on their reading history and suggests books that are most likely to interest the user.

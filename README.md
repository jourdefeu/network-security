## Overwiew

In this Data Science project, you will see how to build a Book Recommendation System model using Machine Learning Techniques.

Recommendation systems are among the most popular applications of data science. They are used to predict the Rating or Preference that a user would give to an item.

## Project structure
The datasets used in this project are:
- `BX-Book-Ratings.csv`
- `BX-Books.csv`
- `BX-Users.csv`

Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing and visualization:

- `code.ipynb`

## Steps

**1. Data Loading and Exploration:**
   - Load the datasets using pandas.
   - Display the first few rows to understand the structure of the dataset.
   - Check for missing values and data types.

**2. Visualization:**
   - Visualize the data on a 2D plot.

**3. Data Preprocessing:**
   - Extract relevant features.
   - Group by items and create a new column.

**4. k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)**
   - Apply the kNN algorithm.
   - Convert our table to a 2D matrix, and fill the missing values with zeros.

## Results

The system analyzes a reader's preferences based on their reading history and suggests books that are most likely to interest the user.
